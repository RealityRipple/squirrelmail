<h2>SquirrelMail Documentation</h2>
<p>
Sorry for the lack of cohesion in the SquirrelMail documentation, but here is a conglomeration
of all the docs that we have accumulated so far.  Maybe some time in the future we will put
together a good documentation system.  This is just meant to get you up and running.  If you find
mistakes, please email them to <a href="lehresma@css.tayloru.edu">lehresma@css.tayloru.edu</a>.

<ul>
   <a href="message_array.html">Message Array Format</a>
   <ul>
      When reading in a message from a mailbox, SquirrelMail shoves all the infomation into a
      large array.  I have attempted to map out that array.  I have done my best to make this
      accurate, but there probably are some inacuracies somewhere.

   <a href="sqimap.php3">SquirrelMail IMAP Functions</a>
   <ul>
      These are a collection of functions designed to replace the PHP imap functions so that you
      don't have to compile in the UW IMAP server into your PHP distrobution.
   </ul>

   <ul>
      If you would like to make a translation of SquirrelMail, here are some guidelines to help
	  you along the way.  These were compiled, thanks to Gustav Foseid.
