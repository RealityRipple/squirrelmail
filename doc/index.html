<h1>SquirrelMail Documentation</h1>

<p>Sorry for the lack of cohesion in the SquirrelMail documentation, but here is a conglomeration
of all the docs that we have accumulated so far.  Maybe some time in the future we will put
together a good documentation system.  This is just meant to get you up and running.</p>
