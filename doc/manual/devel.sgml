<sect>SquirrelMail overview
<p>
SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP4. It includes 
built-in pure PHP support for the IMAP and SMTP protocols, and all pages render
in pure HTML 4.0 (with no JavaScript required) for maximum compatibility across
browsers. It has very few requirements and is very easy to configure and 
install. SquirrelMail has all the functionality you would want from an email 
client, including strong MIME support, address books, and folder manipulation.
