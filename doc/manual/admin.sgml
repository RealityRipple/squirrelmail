<sect>SquirrelMail overview
<p>
SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP4. It includes 
built-in pure PHP support for the IMAP and SMTP protocols, and all pages render
in pure HTML 4.0 (with no JavaScript required) for maximum compatibility across
browsers. It has very few requirements and is very easy to configure and 
install. SquirrelMail has all the functionality you would want from an email 
client, including strong MIME support, address books, and folder manipulation.

<sect1>SquirrelMail Requirements
<sect2>Requirements for running SquirrelMail:
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>UNIX/Linux or Windows (UNIX/Linux version may be more functional)
  <item>IMAP4rev1 server (e.g. uw-imap, courier-imap, cyrus-imap, hMailServer, 
    Binc IMAP, CommuniGate, MS Exchange Server, MercuryMail 32, Dovecot)
  <item>Web server with PHP4 installed (preferably <url
    url="http://httpd.apache.org/" name="Apache httpd">)
  <item>You need at least PHP 4.1.2. If you are using PHP 4.1.2 or 4.1.4, please 
    upgrade to the latest version ( >= 4.1.2.11, >= 4.1.4.1 final).
  <item>Perl installed on the system. (If you don't have Perl, SquirrelMail will 
    work fine but it's very helpful for the initial configuration. 
    Alternatively, you can manually edit the configuration files.)
  <item>Unlike many PHP applications, SquirrelMail does not require MySQL or
    other database type.
  <item>If you use MySQL for the address book or for prefs, note that Pear DB
    lib is required to be installed and available in the include
    path.
  <item>Aspell installed if using the SquirrelSpell plugin, For UNIX/Linux see:
    <url url="http://aspell.sourceforge.net/" name="http://aspell.sourceforge.net/">
    or for Windows, see: <url url="http://aspell.net/win32/" name="http://aspell.net/win32/">
  <item>Japanese language support: PHP must be compiled with the
    <tt/--enable-mbstring/ option for SquirrelMail to read and write Japanese
    emails. Each user must also set their language option to Japanese.
</itemize>

<sect2>Preferred configuration:
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>php with gettext and mbstring support. Without gettext you lose in
    performance. mbstring is actually required if you want a good i18n webmail
    system.
  <item>imap server that supports sort and thread imap extensions. Without these
    extensions you lose in performance.
  <item>imap server should support unicode. CourierIMAP must be compiled with
    <tt/--enable-unicode/ option. Without it some translations might be unable to use
    sorting and threading.
</itemize>

<sect2>Browser Requirements:
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Cookies must be enabled in your browser.
</itemize>
