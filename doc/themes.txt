Themes
======
SquirrelMail users are able to customize the look of the interface by selecting
a custom theme and the font style.

SquirrelMail themes define interface colors. Each theme is a set of 17 or more
colors.

You can easily create your own theme. It is very simple. Just go into the
themes/ directory and create a file called yourtheme_theme.php.
You then need to create an array with 17 elements (0-16). Below is a blank theme
sample followed by a description of what the different entries are for.

---<START>--- 
<?php

/**
 * My Theme
 *
 * Author: My name
 * Date:   Today's date
 *
 * Optional description
 */

global $color;
$color[0]   = '#xxxxxx';
$color[1]   = '#xxxxxx';
$color[2]   = '#xxxxxx';
$color[3]   = '#xxxxxx';
$color[4]   = '#xxxxxx';
$color[5]   = '#xxxxxx';
$color[6]   = '#xxxxxx';
$color[7]   = '#xxxxxx';
$color[8]   = '#xxxxxx';
$color[9]   = '#xxxxxx';
$color[10]  = '#xxxxxx';
$color[11]  = '#xxxxxx';
$color[12]  = '#xxxxxx';
$color[13]  = '#xxxxxx';
$color[14]  = '#xxxxxx';
$color[15]  = '#xxxxxx';
$color[16]  = '#xxxxxx';

---<END>---

Here is descriptions of what the different entries in the array are colors of.
The letter before the number denotes 'b' for background and 'f' for foreground
colors.

b  0: Title bar at the top of the page header
f  1: Error messages border, usually red
f  2: Error messages, usually red
b  3: Left folder list background color
b  4: Normal background color
b  5: Header of the message index [From, Date, Subject]
f  6: Normal text on the left folder list
f  7: Links in the right frame
f  8: Normal text [usually black]
b  9: Darker version of #0
b 10: Darker version of #9
f 11: Special folders color [Inbox, Trash, Sent]
b 12: Alternate color for message list [alters between #4 and this one]
f 13: Color for single-quoted text ('> text') when reading (default: #800000)
f 14: Color for text with more than one quote (default: #ff0000)
f 15: Non-selectable folders in the left frame (default: $color[6])
b 16: Highlight color (default: $color[2])

Next all you have to do is run SquirrelMail configuration utility and add the
theme to the list of themes available to you.
