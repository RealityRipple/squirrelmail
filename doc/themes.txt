Themes
======

To create a theme, it is very simple.  Just go into the themes/ directory
and create a file called yourtheme_theme.php.  You then need to create an
array with 13 elements (0-12).  Below is an example followed by a
description of what the different entries are for.

---<START>--- 
<?php
 
    #  My Theme
    #  Author:  My Name
    #  Date:  Today's Date
    #
    #  Optional description
  
    $color[0]   = '#xxxxxx';
    $color[1]   = '#xxxxxx';
    $color[2]   = '#xxxxxx';
    $color[3]   = '#xxxxxx';
    $color[4]   = '#xxxxxx';
    $color[5]   = '#xxxxxx';
    $color[6]   = '#xxxxxx';
    $color[7]   = '#xxxxxx';
    $color[8]   = '#xxxxxx';
    $color[9]   = '#xxxxxx';
    $color[10]  = '#xxxxxx';
    $color[11]  = '#xxxxxx';
    $color[12]  = '#xxxxxx';
    $color[13]  = '#xxxxxx';
    $color[14]  = '#xxxxxx';
    $color[15]  = '#xxxxxx';

?>
---<END>---

And here is a description of what the different entries in the array
are colors of, and the letter before the number denotes 'b' for background and
'f' for foreground colors.

b  0: Title Bar at the top of the page header
f  1: <not currently used>
f  2: Error messages, usually red
b  3: Left folder list background color
b  4: Normal background color
b  5: Header of the message index [From, Date, Subject]
f  6: Normal text on the left folder list
f  7: Links in the right frame
f  8: Normal text [usually black]
b  9: Darker version of #0
b 10: Darker version of #9
f 11: Special folders color [Inbox, Trash, Sent]
b 12: Alternate color for message list [alters between 4 and this one]
f 13: Color for single-quoted text ('> text') when reading (default:  #800000)
f 14: Color for text with more than one quote (default: #FF0000)
f 15: Non-selectable folders in the left frame (defaults to $color[6])

Next all you have to do is run conf.pl and add the theme to the list
of themes available to you.
