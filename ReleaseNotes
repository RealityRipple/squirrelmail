All about this Release!!!
=========================

This is the second and hopefully last Release Candidate (RC) for the
1.4.x stable series. Please note that this release is not yet labeled
STABLE officially.

It is labeled RC 2a because RC 2 was released but pulled back soon
after because a serious bug was found that needed to be fixed. Thanks
to Jason Munro for discovering this bug.

However, we've been running this on a number of systems and a variety
of configs and we think it's worthy of the "stable"-title. Before we
can call it stable we want to test it on as many systems as possible
to iron out the last issues. 

In response to RC1, quite some issues were reported AND fixed! We now
hope that SquirrelMail is really ready to be called STABLE. We need you
to verify that this is true!

So download it! Install it, and try to break it! We are hungry for any
bug report you send. Even the smallest issue deserves to be fixed.

A note on PHP 4.3.x
===================

While the developers realize that PHP 4.3.x is the "latest and greatest"
version of PHP to be available, SquirrelMail has not been extensively
tested with it. We currently believe that SquirrelMail should work on
PHP 4.3.x but we lack the experience with this new version to be
absolutely sure. If you want to be safe, or experience problems, you may
want to downgrade to PHP 4.2.x.

Major updates
==============

The 1.4.0 series (as a result of 1.3 devel series) brings:

* A complete rewrite of the way we send mail (Deliver-class),
  and of the way we parse mail (MIME-bodystructure parsing).
  This makes SquirrelMail more reliable and more efficient
  at the same time!
* Support for IMAP UID which makes SquirrelMail more reliable.
* Optimizations to code and the number of IMAP calls.
* Support for a wider range of authentication mechanisms.
* Lots of bugfixes and a couple of UI-tweaks.


A note on plugins
=================

There have been major plugin architecture improvements. Lots of plugins
have not yet been adapted to this. Plugins which are distributed with
this release (eg. in the same .tar.gz file) should work. Plugins not
distributed with this plugin most probably WILL NOT WORK.

So if you have ANY problem at all, first try turning off all plugins.


A note on your configuration
============================

For a whole bunch of reasons, it is MANDATORY that you run conf.pl
(and then save your configuration) from the config/ directory before
using this release.

If you have problems with UID support, please do these 2 things:

1) For our comfort and the prosperity of SquirrelMail, send a bug
   report with this information:
     * IMAP server type + version
     * Whether you use server-side sorting
     * Whether you use thread sorting
     * The value of "sort" (as in conf.pl)
   Bugs can be submitted at: http://www.squirrelmail.org/bugs

2) For your own pleasure and comfort:
   Turn off UID support in conf.pl, so you can continue to use 1.4.0
   while the developers look at your report.


Reporting my favorite SquirrelMail 1.4 bug
==========================================

This RC is meant to catch the last bugs. So we need you to submit
any bug you come across! Also, please mention that the bug is in
this 1.4.0 RC2 release.

Thanks for your cooperation with this. That helps us to make
sure nothing slips through the cracks. Also, it would help if
people would check existing tracker items for a bug before reporting
it again. This would help to eliminate duplicate reports, and
increase the time we can spend CODING by DECREASING the time we
spend sorting through bug reports. And remember, check not only OPEN
bug reports, but also closed ones as a bug that you report MAY have
been fixed in CVS already.
