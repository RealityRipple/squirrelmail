Ideas to be implemented
-----------------------

initials = taken by that person

(pl?)   Importing of address books
(nre)   Use PHP4 Session management, get rid of cookies
  -     Make it possible to save preferences in MySQL DB or on Filesystem
  -     Navigation between messages without going to folder list (next, prev)
  -     Configurable headers shown on the message listing, like:  cc, to, etc
  -     Filters
  -     Better inline HTML support including graphics (content-disposition)
  -     Maybe a rewrite of mime.php (see Gustav before any work is done)
  -     Make Location redirects absolute rather than relative (index.php)
  -     Foreground themes
(lme)   Configure script
  -     When deleting or moving messages (empty trash too), go back to the 
            list for the mail box you were looking at without having to click
            a link
  -     Spell checking
(glp)   Customize how many messages are shown at once while reading a mailbox
  -     Cache the sorted messages in mailbox and use that for navigation inside
            of mailbox (next 25, prev 25, etc.)
  -     Search mailbox(es) for given criteria
