Ideas to be implemented
-----------------------

initials = taken by that person

  -     LDAP support for address books
  -     Importing of address books
  -     Better email message body parsing
  -     Use PHP4 Session management, get rid of cookies
  -     Make it possible to save preferences in MySQL DB or on Filesystem
  -     Navigation between messages without going to folder list (next, prev)
  -     Configurable headers shown on the message listing, like:  cc, to, etc
  -     Advanced statuses on messages (Seen, Answered, etc)
  -     Filters
  -     Better inline HTML support including graphics (content-disposition)
  -     Maybe a rewrite of mime.php (see Gustav before any work is done)
  -     Better handling emptying Trash folder.  Some servers don't allow deleting it (Courier)
(lme)   Add "subscribe" to folders section.
  -     Make Location redirects absolute rather than relative (index.php)
  -     POP suport (maybe)
