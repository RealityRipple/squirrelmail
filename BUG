Known BUGS to be fixed before 0.4pre1:

  -    The icon for message sorting doesn't always stay.  It usually reverts back to the date.
  -    If a new message comes in while still browsing cached message list, the space is allocated, but it is blank.
(lme)  I'm not convinced that the cache gets deleted all the time.  I'll look into this one.  
  -    Special folders don't get listed at the top of folder list
  -    In UW, removing folders with a / at the end is broke
