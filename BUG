Known BUGS to be fixed before 0.4pre2:
---------------------TO BE FIXED-----------------------



-----------------------SQUASHED------------------------
--Fixed for 0.4pre2--
(lme)  Sent and Trash are not set to defaults.
(lme)  Does not delete folders correctly in UW that end in /
(lme)  In "Sent" folder, "from" is "Unknown Sender"


--Fixed for 0.4pre1--
(lme)  When more than one line of CCs or TOs is there, it doesn't have
       the (more) or (less) option that used to be there.. only displays
		 the first line.
(lme)  When reading through 7 unread messages, every time I would read
       a message and click on "Message List" to go back, they would stay
		 marked "unread".  The caching was doing too good of a job.  (:
(lme)  If a new message comes in while still browsing cached message 
       list, the space is allocated, but it is blank.
(lme)  I'm not convinced that the cache gets deleted all the time.  I'll 
       look into this one.  
(lme)  LDAP preferences in conf.pl are not working.
(lme)  Next/Previous while viewing a message should take into account 
       the way that the mailbox is sorted.  Right now, it just does it 
		 by the next message id.
(lme)  Special folders don't get listed at the top of folder list
(lme)  The icon for message sorting doesn't always stay.  It usually 
       reverts back to the date.
(lme)  There is an infinate loop when moving messages to other folders, 
       thus breaking the move, and delete buttons.
(lme)  Reply which sets the address line to something like the following:
       "Luke Ehresman <lehresma@css.tayloru.edu>" (without quotes)
       translates to the SMTP server as:
       <lehresma@css.tayloru.edu>>
(lme)  In UW, removing folders with a / at the end is broke
