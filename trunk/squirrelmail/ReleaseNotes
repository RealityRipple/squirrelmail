All about this Release!!!
=========================

This is the first Release Candidate (RC) for the 1.4.x stable series.
Please note that this release is not yet labeled STABLE officially.

However, we've been running this on a number of systems and a variety
of configs and we think it's worthy of the "stable"-title. Before we
can call it stable we want to test it on as many systems as possible
to iron out the last issues. 

So download it! Install it, and try to break it! We are hungry for any
bug report you send. 


Major updates
==============

The 1.4.0 series (as a result of 1.3 devel series) brings:

* A complete rewrite of the way we send mail (Deliver-class),
  and of the way we parse mail (MIME-bodystructure parsing).
  This makes SquirrelMail more reliable and more efficient
  at the same time!
* Support for IMAP UID which makes SquirrelMail more reliable.
* Optimizations to code and the number of IMAP calls.
* Support for a wider range of authentication mechanisms.
* Lots of bugfixes and a couple of UI-tweaks.



A note on plugins
=================

There have been very severe architecture improvements. Lots of plugins
have not yet been adapted to this. Plugins which are distributed with
this release (eg. in the same .tar.gz file) may work. Plugins not
distributed with this plugin most probably WILL NOT WORK.

So if you have ANY problem at all, first try turning off all plugins.


A note on your configuration
============================

For a whole bunch of reasons, it is MANDATORY that you run conf.pl
(and then save your configuration) from the config/ directory before
using this release.

If you have problems with UID support, please do these 2 things:

1) For our comfort and the prosper of SquirrelMail:
   send a bugreport with this information
     * IMAP server type + version
     * Whether you use server-side sorting
     * Whether you use thread sorting
     * The value of "sort" (as in conf.pl)
   bugs can be submitted at: http://www.squirrelmail.org/bugs
2) For your own pleasure and comfort:
   turn of UID support in conf.pl, so you can continue to use 1.4.0


Reporting my favorite SquirrelMail 1.4 bug
==========================================

This RC is meant to catch the last bugs. So we need you to submit
any bug you come across! Also, please mention that the bug is in
this 1.4.0 RC1 release.

   http://www.squirrelmail.org/bugs

Thank you for your cooperation in that issue. That helps us to make
sure that nothing slips through the cracks. Also, it would help if
people would check existing tracker items for a bug before reporting
it again. This would help to eliminate duplicate reports, and
increase the time we can spend CODING by DECREASING the time we
spend sorting through bug reports. And remember, check not only OPEN
bug reports, but also closed ones as a bug that you report MAY have
been fixed in CVS already.

In case you want to join us on coding SquirrelMail, or have other
things to share with the developers, join the development mailinglist:
