All about this Release!
=======================

This is the first release of our new 1.5.x-series, which is a 
DEVELOPMENT release. 

See the Major Updates section of this file for more.


Major updates
==============

1.5.0 includes the integration of the delete_move_next plugin, 
as well as a new "save replies to the same folder as the original"
option. 


Data directory
==============

The directory data/ used to be included in our tarball. Since placing this
dir under a web accessible directory is not very wise, we've decided to not
pack it anymore; you need to create it yourself. Please choose a location
that's safe, e.g. somewhere under /var.


Reporting my favorite SquirrelMail 1.4 bug
==========================================

We constantly aim to make SquirrelMail even better. So we need you to
submit any bug you come across! Also, please mention that the bug is
in this 1.5.0 release, and list your IMAP server and webserver details.

Thanks for your cooperation with this. That helps us to make
sure nothing slips through the cracks. Also, it would help if
people would check existing tracker items for a bug before reporting
it again. This would help to eliminate duplicate reports, and
increase the time we can spend CODING by DECREASING the time we
spend sorting through bug reports. And remember, check not only OPEN
bug reports, but also closed ones as a bug that you report MAY have
been fixed in CVS already.

If you want to join us in coding SquirrelMail, or have other
things to share with the developers, join the development mailinglist:
