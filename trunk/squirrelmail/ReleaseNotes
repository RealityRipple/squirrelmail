All about this Release!
=======================

This is the second release of our new 1.5.x-series, which is a 
DEVELOPMENT release. 

See the Major Updates section of this file for more.


Major updates
==============
Rewritten IMAP functions and added extra data caching code. Internal sorting 
functions should be faster than code used in SquirrelMail 1.5.0 and older 
versions. Data caching should reduce number of IMAP calls in folder management 
and mailbox status functions. 

Own gettext implementation replaced with PHP Gettext classes. Update adds 
ngettext and dgettext support.

Templates, css and error handler. 

Own cookie functions

Updated wrapping functions in compose.


Security updates
================

This release contains security fixes applied to development branch after 1.5.0 
release.
CVE-2004-0521 - SQL injection vulnerability in address book.
CVE-2004-1036 - XSS exploit in decodeHeader function.
CVE-2005-0075 - Potential file inclusion in preference backend selection code.
CVE-2005-0103 - Possible file/offsite inclusion in src/webmail.php.
CVE-2005-0104 - Possible XSS issues in src/webmail.php.
CVE-2005-1769 - Several cross site scripting (XSS) attacks.
CVE-2005-2095 - Extraction of all POST variables in advanced identity code.


Plugin updates
==============
Added site configuration options to filters, fortune, translate, newmail, 
bug_report plugins. Improved newmail and change_password plugins.

SquirrelSpell data storage


Possible issues
===============
Cookies
Plugins (changes in hooks and IMAP API)
IMAP sorting/threading

Backward incompatible changes
=============================
Index order options are modified in 1.5.1 version. If older options are 
detected, interface upgrades to newer option format and deletes old options.

In 1.5.1 version SquirrelSpell user dictionaries are saved with generic 
SquirrelMail data functions. Code should copy older dictionary, if dictionary 
version information is not present in user preferences. Once dictionary is 
copied, <username>.words files are obsolete and no longer updated.

If same data directory is used with other backwards incompatible version, older
SquirrelMail version can lose some user preferences or work with outdated data.

Data directory
==============

The directory data/ used to be included in our tarball. Since placing this dir 
under a web accessible directory is not very wise, we've decided to not pack it
anymore; you need to create it yourself. Please choose a location that's safe, 
e.g. somewhere under /var.


Reporting my favorite SquirrelMail bug
======================================

We constantly aim to make SquirrelMail even better. So we need you to submit 
any bug you come across! Also, please mention that the bug is in this 1.5.1 
release, and list your IMAP server and webserver details.

   http://www.squirrelmail.org/bugs

Thanks for your cooperation with this. That helps us to make sure nothing slips
through the cracks. Also, it would help if people would check existing tracker 
items for a bug before reporting it again. This would help to eliminate 
duplicate reports, and increase the time we can spend CODING by DECREASING the 
time we spend sorting through bug reports. And remember, check not only OPEN 
bug reports, but also closed ones as a bug that you report MAY have been fixed 
in CVS already.

About Our Release Alias
=======================

This release is labeled the "Fire in the Hole" release. "Fire in the hole" is 
a phrase used to warn of the detonation of an explosive device. The phrase may 
have been originated by miners, who made extensive use of explosives while 
working underground.

Release is created in order to get fixed package after two years of development
in HEAD branch. Package contains many experimental changes. Changes add new 
features, that can be unstable and cause inconsistent UI. If you want to use 
stable code, you should stick to SquirrelMail 1.4.x series. If you find issues 
in this package, make sure that they are still present in latest development 
code snapshots. 

                  Happy SquirrelMailing!
