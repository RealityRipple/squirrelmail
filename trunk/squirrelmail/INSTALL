Sorry for the incomplete documentation at this time.  Here is a quick
overview of how to install SquirrelMail.

1.  Make Apache (or whatever web server) happy with PHP4.

2.  Unarchive SquirrelMail in a subdirectory that is accessable by the
    web server.  EX: /home/httpd/html/squirrelmail-0.1

3.  Edit the config file, config/config.php

4.  Change the permissons for the "data/" directory so it's writable to
    the web server.  Under Red Hat Linux 6.0, this is done by:

    chown -R nobody data
    chgrp -R nobody data

    "nobody" is the user and group for the apache server for this
    example.

5.  Point your browser to the location you specified in step 2.
    In this example, it's:  http://YOURHOST/squirrelmail-0.1/index.html
