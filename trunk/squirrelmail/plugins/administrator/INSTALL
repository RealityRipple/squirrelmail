Administrator Plugin
-------------------- 2002 Philippe Mingo <philippe@squirrelmail.org>

This is still untested and unfinished alpha code.

In order to use the plugin you must activate it through conf.pl
and change its permissions to 660. That file must be owned by
the user you want to have access to that plugin (only one) and
the group of the user that is running php.

Use this plugin at your won risk, and never before to make a backup
of the config.php file. The code is not tested and not finished.
