Master Change Password plugin
-----------------------------

WHAT'S THIS?
This plugin is a general framework for enabling the user to
change his/her password. It allows for different backend
to perform this task on different systems.

STATUS
Development

CONFIGURATION
Edit the file config.php to set the backend you want to use.
Probably, you need to set some config vars in the backend too
(backend/<yourbackend>.php).

BACKENDS
- mysql

  Default settings are supplied in backends/mysql.php.

  You do not have to change any configuration vars in 
  backend/mysql.php - instead, create an array in config.php 
  containing the variable you want to override, for example:

  To override the server name ($mysql_server), you would add
    $mysql['server'] = 'remote_servername';
  to config.php.
