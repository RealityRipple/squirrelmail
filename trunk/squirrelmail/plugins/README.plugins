To understand more about plugins, read doc/plugin.txt

For the impatient, here is an extremely brief overview of how to
install plugins.

  1.  Change to the plugins directory.

        $ cd plugins/

  2.  Unarchive the plugin.

        $ tar -zxvf /home/me/myplugin.tar.gz

  3.  Note the directory that the plugin was created into.  For this
      example, we will assume it was put in the directory: myplugin/.

  4.  Go to the config directory and run conf.pl

        $ cd ../../config/
        $ ./conf.pl

  5.  Choose option 8 and proceed to add the new plugin following
      the instructions there.  Save and exit, and your plugin should
      be in place.
