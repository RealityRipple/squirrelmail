Address Book Take -- Version 1.3

If you would like to add the sender of a message you're reading to your
address book quickly and easily without cutting and pasting, then this
plugin simplifies the process.  It scans the mail message you're reading
for any email address and lets you add it with a quick form.


Features
========

* Saves you the need to Cut & Paste
* Steals from the To, From, Reply-To, and CC fields
* Steals from the body of the message
* Address verification (pretty good)


Description
===========

By pulling down a list and selecting the address you want to add, you
are then presented with a familiar Add to Personal Address Book screen.
By filling out this form, you will then add the email address to your
personal address book.

The user can decide if the box is shown, where it is shown on the bottom
of the Read screen, and whether or not to attempt to verify that the
address works.

When trying to verify if the address works, it checks to see if the host
has any DNS record available.  Usually this will work.


Future Work
===========

* Maybe grab the name, if available
* Search more headers (when they become available)
* Steal from the body of the message directly (when possible)
* When new domains are added, update the email verification function


Installation
============

As with other plugins, just uncompress the archive in the plugins
directory, go back to the main directory, run configure and add the plugin.
