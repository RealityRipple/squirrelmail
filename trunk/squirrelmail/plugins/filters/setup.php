 * Message and Spam Filter Plugin
 *
 * Copyright (c) 1999-2002 The SquirrelMail Project Team
 * Licensed under the GNU GPL. For full terms see the file COPYING.
 *
 * This plugin filters your inbox into different folders based upon given
 * criteria.  It is most useful for people who are subscibed to mailing lists
 * to help organize their messages.  The argument stands that filtering is
 * not the place of the client, which is why this has been made a plugin for
 * SquirrelMail.  You may be better off using products such as Sieve or
 * Procmail to do your filtering so it happens even when SquirrelMail isn't
 * running.
 *
 * If you need help with this, or see improvements that can be made, please
 * email me directly at the address above.  I definately welcome suggestions
 * and comments.  This plugin, as is the case with all SquirrelMail plugins,
 * is not directly supported by the developers.  Please come to me off the
 * mailing list if you have trouble with it.
 *
 * Also view plugins/README.plugins for more information.
