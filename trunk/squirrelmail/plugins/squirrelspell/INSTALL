SquirrelSpell-v0.3.1
---------------------

Untar SquirrelSpell into your squirrelmail/plugins directory. Move
sqspell_config.dist to sqspell_config.php if this is a fresh install. If
upgrading, just untar over your old installation.

Modify the sqspell_config.php file making sure you have ispell or aspell
available on your system and located in PHP's path. The squirrelspell
doesn't check for that and if it is not available, you're just going to
get a "No errors found"  message every time. :) Quite pleasing, but not
very useful.

Read files in "doc" directory -- they explain some features.

Enable the plugin either by hand or by running the configure script from
your squirrelmail install directory.

Enjoy and report bugs. ;)
