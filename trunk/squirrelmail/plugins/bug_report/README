Bug Reporter

Need to submit a bug?  Need to know valuable system information?  Need
to be accurate?  This should do it for you.


Features
========

* You save yourself a lot of typing
* By default, this is not enabled.
* Provides detailed setup information to help diagnose your problem
* Has some warnings that can help out the person submitting the bug report


Description
===========

When people stumble across a bug, which may happen in a work-in-progress,
often times they would like to help out the software and get rid of the bug.
Sometimes, these people don't know much about the system and how it is set
up -- they know enough to make the bug happen for them.  This bug report
plugin is designed to gather all of the non-private information for the user
automatically, so that the user doesn't need to know more than how to trigger
the bug.


Future Work
===========

* Add more data
* Add more warnings


Installation
============

You must configure plugin before you enable it in your SquirrelMail
installation. Plugin's configuration is stored in 
config/bug_report_config.php or plugins/bug_report/config.php files. 
Configuration options can be found in plugins/bug_report/config_default.php
file.

If both configuration files are present, plugin uses the one in
config/ directory.

By default plugin is visible only to users listed in 
plugins/bug_report/admins or config/admins file or only to user
that owns main SquirrelMail configuration file. Other users can use 
bug_report plugin, if you set administrator's email in plugin's 
configuration and set $bug_report_allow_users option to true.

Once plugin is configured, go back to the main directory, run configure 
and enable the plugin.
