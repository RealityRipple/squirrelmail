Ideas to be implemented
-----------------------

initials = taken by that person

(pl?)   Importing of address books
  -     Make it possible to save preferences in MySQL DB or on Filesystem
  -     Configurable headers shown on the message listing, like:  cc, to, etc
  -     Filters
  -     Better inline HTML support including graphics (content-disposition)
  -     Foreground themes
(glp)   When deleting or moving messages (empty trash too), go back to the 
            list for the mail box you were looking at without having to click
            a link
(mcp)   Spell checking
(ssg)   Search mailbox(es) for given criteria
  -     Remove subject and body requirements in Compose
  -     Select multiple Unsubscribe/Subscribe folders at one time
