Ideas to be implemented
-----------------------

initials = taken by that person

(pl?)   Importing of address books
  -     Make it possible to save preferences in MySQL DB or on Filesystem
  -     Configurable headers shown on the message listing, like:  cc, to, etc
  -     Filters
  -     Better inline HTML support including graphics (content-disposition)
  -     Foreground themes
  -     Configurable so that after login, you go directly to INBOX
(glp)   When deleting or moving messages (empty trash too), go back to the 
            list for the mail box you were looking at without having to click
            a link
(mcp)   Spell checking
(ssg)   Search mailbox(es) for given criteria
  -     Remove subject and body requirements in Compose
  -     Select multiple Unsubscribe/Subscribe folders at one time
  -     decodeHeader on to_ary, cc_ary, and filename
  -     Decode folder names for non-standard characters
