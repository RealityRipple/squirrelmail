Upgrading from 0.3 or higher 
============================

If you are upgrading from versions 0.3 or higher of SquirrelMail, you can
use this guide to make the transition a bit smoother.  If you have been
using a previous version (0.1 or 0.2), it is suggested that you just start
from scratch and configure your settings as if it was your first install.

NOTE: The new plugin architecture required the use of some functions which
are not in all versions of PHP4. You will need at least PHP4 beta2. If you
need to upgrade please go ahead and install the latest release version of
PHP4.


1.  Backup old install
======================

Make a backup of your current SquirrelMail directory.  If you use "cp", be
sure to use the "-Rp" options.  -R means recursive, and -p will save the
permissions in the directory.

In this example, we assume that your httpd document directory is 
/home/httpd/html, that your SquirrelMail install is located at
/home/httpd/html/squirrelmail-1.0.6, and that your new SM version is 1.2.0.
Substitute version numbers and names as required.

  $ cd /home/httpd/html
  $ cp -Rp squirrelmail-1.0.6 squirrelmail-1.0.6.bak


2.  Unarchive new SquirrelMail
==============================
Make sure that you are in your httpd document directory (/home/httpd/html)
and then unarchive the SquirrelMail archive (whatever the filename is): 

  $ tar -zxvf squirrelmail-1.2.0.tar.gz


3.  Copy important files from old install
=========================================
The important files to copy are:
  A.  Preferences
  B.  Config details
  C.  Plugins
  D.  Themes (if you've edited or added any of them)
  
A.  Preferences

First, copy your preference data over to the new directory.  Usually
this is ok, but if you are upgrading from anything less than 1.0.5, we
strongly suggest you let your users reset their preferences.  There
were important security upgrades in 1.0.5 regarding preference files.
  
  $ cp squirrelmail-1.0.6.bak/data/* squirrelmail-1.2.0/data
  
B.  Config details

If at all possible, start the configuration process from scratch.  It is 
much less prone to missing configuration options than copying your old
configuration.  Ideally, you should just run conf.pl to reconfigure
SquirrelMail.  If you decide to copy your old config.php over, we strongly
recommend that you run conf.pl to make sure things are correct and then save
the config file.

  $ cp squirrelmail-1.0.6.bak/config/config.php squirrelmail-1.2.0/config

C.  Copy plugins

Like SquirrelMail, plugins are frequently updated for improvements, as well
as to make them compatible with new SquirrelMail releases.  It is suggested
that you download a new plugins archive at the same time you download your
SquirrelMail install, and that you install your plugins fresh (it's easy,
don't panic!).

If you prefer to just copy your old plugins over (if it's the same version
or if you are lazy), you may do so.  If you notice irregularities with the
plugins under the new SquirrelMail, try installing new versions of the
plugins.

  $ cp -Rp squirrelmail-1.0.6.bak/plugins/* squirrelmail-1.2.0/plugins
  
D.  Copy themes

If you've created or modified themes, you should copy just those to the new
SquirrelMail themes directory.  To just copy them all over to the new
SquirrelMail installation, you can run one command.

  $ cp squirrelmail-1.0.6.bak/themes/* squirrelmail-1.2.0/themes/

(While you are at it, you should send them to us!  We might add them to the
themes in the standard install!)


4.  Change permissions
======================
The web server must have write permission to the data directory.  In this
example, we assume that user "nobody" and group "nobody" are the web server
as is often the case with Apache.

  $ cd squirrelmail-1.2.0
  $ chown -R nobody.nobody data
  
See INSTALL for alternate userid/groupid pairs.  Additionally, if "chown
user.group" doesn't work, you can use "chown user" and "chgrp group"
instead.  See the man pages for these commands for more information.


5.  Run conf.pl
===============
Run config/conf.pl to see the new configuration options available with the
new version, as well as to verify that all of your old options are set
properly.

When you have migrated plugins from your old install to your new
install, or even use any plugins at all, you *must* run conf.pl and do
the following:

A.  Select "8" (Plugins)
B.  Select "A" (Sanitize all plugins for use with Squirrelmail 1.2)

This will make sure the plugins work more efficiently (and will
release you from any "cannot redeclare" error messages).

6.  DONE!
=========
That should be all!  The most important part is copying your users'
preference files back into the new data directory.  This will insure that
your users will have their old preferences.  Remember to do so with caution,
especially if you are upgrading from a version before 1.0.5 to version 1.0.5
or later.
