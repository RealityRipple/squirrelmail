       Theme Name:   "July Fourth Theme"

       This is the default theme that comes standard with SquirrelMail.
       Most of the colors were taken from mail.yahoo.com's theme on their
       site.

       To create a new theme, just copy this file, and edit the colors.
       Be sure to rename the file and keep the original, just in case.

       NOTE:
       Please email any themes you create to luke@usa.om.org for inclusion
       in further releases of SquirrelMail and for download from the web
       page.
