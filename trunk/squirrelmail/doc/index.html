<h2>SquirrelMail Documentation</h2>
<p>
Sorry for the lack of cohesion in the SquirrelMail documentation, but here is a conglomeration
of all the docs that we have accumulated so far.  Maybe some time in the future we will put
together a good documentation system.  This is just meant to get you up and running.  If you find
mistakes, please email them to <a href="luke@squirrelmail.org">luke@squirrelmail.org</a>.
