HOW TO CONFIGURE SQUIRRELMAIL WITH RUSSIAN APACHE
--------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Russian Apache will recode all attachments, even if they
are binary, thus corrupting them. To fix this problem, refer to
Russian Apache FAQ: http://apache.lexa.ru/faq.html#5
Turn multipart form recoding off in your apache config. If you
don't, you're in for mucho trouble.

This howto is for people who are using Russian Apache and
who use charsets other than koi8-r for their source documents.
If you _do_ use KOI8-R as default encoding for all your source
documents, you don't need to do anything. Otherwise, here's
a very simple way to make this work.

The general idea is to tell Russian Apache that everything 
residing in the squirrel-mail directory is in koi8-r. This
way all input submitted by users will be automagically 
converted by mod_charset from anything into koi8-r.
Squirrel-Mail will then correctly stamp it with
"Charset=koi8-r" and send off without any additional
conversion.

There are two equally efficient ways to do it:


1. THE HTTPD.CONF WAY.
-----------------------

In your httpd.conf, add the following declaration for the
server that handles the squirrel-mail:

<Directory /path/to/your/squirrel-mail>
CharsetSourceEnc koi8-r
</Directory>

Warning: If you use CharsetByExtension elsewhere, it will 
override the CharsetSourceEnc directive. In that case you will 
have to put this directive instead of the above:

<Directory /path/to/your/squirrel-mail>
CharsetByExtension koi8-r .php
</Directory>

It is advised to use the CharsetSourceEnc declaration instead
of the other one. Use the CharsetByExtension only if the
other fails.

2. THE .HTACCESS WAY (PREFERRED).
----------------------------------

Create a .htaccess file in your squirrel-mail directory. In it,
simply put this line:

CharsetSourceEnc koi8-r

That's it. Note the warning about the ChatsetByExtension directive
in the previous section. If you used CharsetByExtension declaration
elsewhere and it's active for this server, then you will have to
put this line in your .htaccess instead:

CharsetByExtension koi8-r .php

But again, this is only if the CharsetSourceEnc fails.

I mark this method "Preferred" simply because you don't have to 
restart your server if you use .htaccess. However, if you've
specified "AllowOverride None" in your Server config, then you
will have to go with "the httpd.conf way".

promptly answered. ;)
