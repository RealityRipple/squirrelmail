Internet Explorer and SSL

=====================================

I've just spent the last few days trying to track down the now famous bug
with IE and SSL.  The problem lies in the fact that PHP sends some no-cache
headers whenever a session is started.  IE chokes when trying to download a
file that it can't cache over SSL.  We use session management to store many
things, one being the key to decypher the password.

Once we had figured out that it was sessions in PHP that was causing the
problem, we tried turning the session management off in the download script
in Squirrelmail.  This introduced another problem for us because we NEEDED
sessions to decypher the key so we could log into the IMAP server and
download the attachment.

Next we tried leaving the sessions turned off, but passed the key in through
a GET parameter.  This worked, but is obviously not a very secure way of
handling things.

Our quest continued for a good solution.  Finally, I was browsing through
the source of PHP, I noticed the 2 headers it was sending were "Pragma" and
"Cache-Control".  I had the crazy idea of defining these again after the
session had been started, and lo and behold, it worked!  Below is the code
that made this work:

     session_start()
	 header("Pragma: ");
	 header("Cache-Control: cache");

With all the testing I have done, this works, and works very well for all
browsers.
