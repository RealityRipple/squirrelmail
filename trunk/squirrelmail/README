   1.1 - About SquirrelMail

   So what exactly is SquirrelMail?  It's a web interface to email that's
   written in PHP4.  It was designed to allow email access through your
   server from anywhere in the world via the Web.



   1.2 - History

   The need arose in our organization for the access of email and address
   books from anywhere in the world. Obviously a web interface is ideal
   for this, given that the user has access to the Internet.  After
   reviewing several open source projects we realized that we were going
   to need to do some fairly major customizations to get things to be a
   nice fit for our needs. So the decision was made to create our own for
   some of these reasons, and for fun (we really like PHP4). We decided
   to open source the project to contribute to the community that has
   contributed so much to us.

   Frequently Asked Questions
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Q: Can SquirrelMail be run with PHP3?

      Yes, and No. It is fully developed under PHP4 BETA3, however PHP is
      pretty good about backwards compatability. Theoretically, it
      shouldn't be too hard to port it to PHP3, but you definately would
      have to do some code tweaking. Let us know of any success or horror
      stories if you attempt it.

   Q: Why PHP4 when it's only in BETA?

      PHP4 is significantly faster than PHP3. When we were viewing
      mailboxes with 500-1000 messages in them, it would take about 15-30
      seconds to sort them. With PHP4, that time has been cut down to 5-10
      seconds for large boxes.

   Q: Where did you get the name, "SquirrelMail"?

      It's derived from the over-abundant squirrel population in Georgia
      this year. We were playing volleyball one day, and saw a squirrel
      try to jump between trees. He failed miserably and fell 40 feet to
      the ground. So, we had squirrels on our mind the next day when we
      were coming up with a name.
      
   Q: Is SquirrelMail stable enough to actually use?
      SquirrelMail is stable, however, many of the features that are 
      usually desired from an email client have not yet been implemented.
