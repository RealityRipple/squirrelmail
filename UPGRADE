Upgrading from 0.3 or 0.4
=========================
If you are upgrading from versions 0.3 or 0.4 of SquirrelMail, you can use this
guide to make the transition a bit smoother.  If you have been using a previous
version (0.1 or 0.2), it is suggested that you just start from scratch and 
configure your settings as if it was your first install.

NOTE: The new plugin architecture required the use of some functions which are
not in all versions of PHP4. You will need at least PHP4 beta2. If you need to
upgrade please go ahead and install the latest release version of PHP4.

1.  Backups
===========
Make a backup of your current SquirrelMail directory.  If you use "cp", be sure
to use the "-Rp" options.  -R means recursive, and -p will save the permissions
in the directory.  In this example, we assume that your httpd document directory
is /home/httpd/html.

  $ cd /home/httpd/html
  $ cp -Rp squirrelmail-0.4 squirrelmail-0.4.bak


2.  Unarchives Squirrelmail-0.5.tar.gz
======================================
Make sure that you're in your httpd document directory (/home/httpd/html) and
then unarchive the squirrelmail archive (whatever the filename is):
 
  $ tar -zxvf squirrelmail-0.5.tar.gz


3.  Copy backups in place
=========================
Here is the main part.  There are two parts to this step: copy preferences,
and copy config details.  The preference files are backwards compatible, so it
is fine to copy the old user preferences into the new directory.  However, the
configuration file has changed quite a bit, so you will want to be sure to run
the configure script (conf.pl) to set up any new config details.

First, copy the files in place:
  
  $ cp squirrelmail-0.4.bak/data/* squirrelmail-0.5/data
  $ cp squirrelmail-0.4.bak/config/config.php squirrelmail-0.5/config

Note that if at all possible, start the configuration process from scratch.
It is less prone to missing configuration options than copying your old
configuration.  The ideal solution would be to copy your users' preference
files, and then run conf.pl to re-configure SquirrelMail (without using the
old config file).  If you do copy the config.php file, you will want to run
conf.pl and check for new options.


4.  Change permissions
======================
The web server must have write permission to the data directory.  In this
example, we assume that user "nobody" and group "nobody" are the web server
as is often the case with Apache.

  $ cd squirrelmail-0.5
  $ chown -R nobody.nobody data


5.  DONE!
=========
That should be all!  The most important part is copying your users' preference
files back into the new data directory.  This will insure that your users will
have their old preferences.
