Installing Plugins
==================
Simply untar the file in the plugins directory, and make sure it is
in its own directory, and that the name of the directory is the name
of the plugin.  Example below uses "plug_demo" as the name of the 
plugin:

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf /usr/archives/plug_demo.tar.gz

Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose option
8 and add the plugin.  Save and exit, then that should be all
if the plugin was made correctly.  :)

  $ cd ../config
  $ ./conf.pl

Some plugin settings might be adjusted by creating config/translate_config.php or
plugins/translate/config.php configuration file. See plugins/translate/config_default.php 
and plugins/translate/config-sample.php
