Ok, this is my first attempt at a plugin, so excuse the mess you may find
in here.

This plugin is used to play sounds (currently a WAV file) through the
browser whenever the user has unseen messages flagged in the left window
pane.  There are options available (on the options page of course) to
disable this feature for each user, and to select different media files
from the users local computer.  The default is that this is NOT enabled,
so you'll need to go to the options menu to turn it on first! There are
also options to show a popup window via JavaScript.

I tried to make this fairly simple to install.  To install the plugin:

  1.  Change to the plugins directory.

        $ cd plugins/

  2.  Unarchive the plugin.

        $ tar zxvf /your/path/to/newmail-x.x.tgz

  2.  This should create a newmail/ directory under plugins.

  4.  Go to the config directory and run conf.pl

        $ cd ../../config/
        $ ./conf.pl

  5.  Choose option 8 and proceed to add the new plugin following
      the instructions there.  Save and exit, and your plugin should
      be in place.

Any questions, you can let me know --
