This plugin is used to play sounds (currently a WAV file) through the
browser whenever the user has unseen messages flagged in the left window
pane.  There are options available (on the options page of course) to
disable this feature for each user, and to select different media files
from the users local computer.  The default is that this is NOT enabled,
so you'll need to go to the options menu to turn it on first! There are
also options to show a popup window via JavaScript.

From SquirrelMail 1.5.1 newmail plugin's site configuration can be stored in
config/newmail_config.php or plugins/newmail/config.php.

$allowsound setting is replaced with $newmail_allowsound and should be stored
inside plugin's site configuration file.
