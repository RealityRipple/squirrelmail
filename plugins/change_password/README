Master Change Password plugin
-----------------------------

WHAT'S THIS?
This plugin is a general framework for enabling the user to
change his/her password. It allows for different backend
to perform this task on different systems.

STATUS
Development

CONFIGURATION
Edit the file config.php to set the backend you want to use.
Probably, you need to set some config vars in the backend too
(backend/<yourbackend>.php).

BACKENDS
- mysql

  Default settings are supplied in backends/mysql.php.

  You do not have to change any configuration vars in 
  backend/mysql.php - instead, create an array in config.php 
  containing the variable you want to override, for example:

  To override the server name ($mysql_server), you would add
    $mysql['server'] = 'remote_servername';
  to config.php.


- merak

  Default settings are supplied in backends/merak.php.


- poppassd

  Default settings are supplied in backends/poppassd.php.


- vmailmgrd

  Default settings are supplied in backends/vmailmgrd.php.
  
  Site configuration is controlled in config.php $vmailmgrd 
  array. Backend uses 'vmail_inc_path', 'vm_tcphost', 
  'vm_tcphost_port' and 'cpw_vmailmgrd_8bitpw' array keys.
  
  'vmail_inc_path' sets path to vmail.inc. 'vm_tcphost' sets
  vmailmgrd tcp service ip address or dns name. Plugin uses 
  vmailmgrd socket, if it is not set. 'vm_tcphost_port' sets 
  port of vmailmrgd service. Plugin uses port 322, if it is 
  not set. 'cpw_vmailmgrd_8bitpw' controls use of 8bit 
  passwords. If it is not set, interface does not allow new 
  passwords with 8bit symbols.

  $vmailmgrd['vmail_inc_path'] setting is required.
