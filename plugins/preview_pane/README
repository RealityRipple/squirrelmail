Preview Pane plugin for SquirrelMail
====================================
Ver 2.0, 2007/01/23

Original author: Paul Lesniewski <paul@squirrelmail.org>


Description
===========

This plugin allows the user to turn on an extra frame below
the mailbox message list where the messages themselves are 
displayed, very similar to many other popular (typically
non-web-based) email clients.

Note that users must turn this functionality on by going to
the Options-->Display Preferences menu.  

This plugin is part of the SquirrelMail core package and
should never be replaced with a downloaded copy (that which
is available on the SquirrelMail website under Plugins is
only applicable to SquirrelMail 1.4.x).

This plugin should be activated only by a skin (template set)
that is capable of displaying a message preview pane.  One
such skin (template set) is the "default advanced" one that
comes with the SquirrelMail base package.



License
=======

This plugin is released under the GNU General Public
License (see the file COPYING for details).



Requirements
============

  * SquirrelMail version 1.5.2+



Help Requests
=============

Help requests should be posted to the SquirrelMail Plugins 
mailing list.

Change Log
==========

  v2.0  2007/01/23  Paul Lesniewski
   * Integration into SquirrelMail core
   * Strip out most interface functionality; migrate to "default
     advanced" template set
   * Only works with 1.5.2+

  v1.3  2007/01/19  Paul Lesniewski <paul@squirrelmail.org>
   * Introduce slight delay refreshing message list so read messages
     actually refresh as having been read
   * Added 1.4.9 patch; versions between 1.4.3 and 1.4.9 should be
     patch-able with the 1.4.3 patch
   * Added 1.4.9 patch for delete, move, next plugin
   * Added 1.5.1 patch, then removed it  ;-p  1.5.2 supports this
     functionality natively.

     this plugin; translators please send your translations to the
     squirrelmail-i18n mailing list
   * Added requisite informational functions in setup.php per plugin specs
   * Use $PHP_SELF instead of REQUEST_URI, since apparently the latter is not
     always 100% reliable.

  v1.2  2004/06/08  Paul Lesniewski <paul@squirrelmail.org>

   * Added Greek locale (Thanks to Alexandros Vellis <avel@noc.uoa.gr>)
   * Updated patch for compatibility with Archive Mail plugin version 1.2

     06/08/04)
