Bug Reporter

Need to submit a bug?  Need to know valuable system information?  Need
to be accurate?  This should do it for you.


Features
========

* You save yourself a lot of typing
* By default, this is not enabled.
* Provides detailed setup information to help diagnose your problem
* Has some warnings that can help out the person submitting the bug report


Description
===========

When people stumble across a bug, which may happen in a work-in-progress,
often times they would like to help out the software and get rid of the bug.
Sometimes, these people don't know much about the system and how it is set
up -- they know enough to make the bug happen for them.  This bug report
plugin is designed to gather all of the non-private information for the user
automatically, so that the user doesn't need to know more than how to trigger
the bug.


Future Work
===========

* Add more data
* Add more warnings


Installation
============

Go back to the main directory, run configure and add the plugin.
