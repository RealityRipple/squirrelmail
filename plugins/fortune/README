Simple SquirrelMail plugin that displays the quotes above the message listing.

Original code contributed by paulm@spider.org, now maintained by the
SquirrelMail Project Team.

short text messages. If you are running php in safe_mode, path to program must 
be present in php safe_mode_exec_dir setting. If you are running chrooted 
webserver, program must be present inside of your chroot jail.

plugins/fortune/config.php files.
