Installing Fortune Plugin
=========================
Simply untar the file in the plugins directory, and make sure it is
in its own directory, and that the name of the directory is the name
of the plugin.  Example below uses "fortune" as the name of the 
directory:

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf /usr/archives/fortune_plugin.tar.gz

Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose option
8 and add the plugin (+).  Save and exit, then that should be all
if the plugin was made correctly.  :)

  $ cd ../config
  $ ./conf.pl

Configuration is stored in config/fortune_config.php or 
plugins/fortune/config.php. System won't load plugins/fortune/config.php,
if config/fortune_config.php is present. Default configuration values 
are stored in plugins/fortune/config_default.php.
